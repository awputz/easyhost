> **AI-Powered Hosting for Everyone** - Making web hosting accessible to non-technical users

## What is EZ-Host.ai?

EZ-Host.ai is a self-hosted asset portal that makes web hosting **dead simple** for people with zero technical skills. Upload files, get shareable links, and let our AI assistant guide you through everything.
